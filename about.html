        <h2> Around the age of 12, I was diagnosed with <span class="featured-text">ADHD and Dyslexia</span></h2>
        <p class="editable">
            I remember the day vividly. I was in the psychologists office. I didn’t want to be there. I was annoyed and upset. I had to make up an excuse to my friends and told them I was sick when they asked where I was.             
        </p>
        <p class="editable">
            Reading the test results made me angry. They were the most sterile review about who I was as a person. They were written as if I was never going to read them but told me everything I was horrible at. I hated every minute of it.
        </p>
        <p class="editable">
            At the time, I viewed ADHD as a cruse. I was placed into separate classes for math and English. A friend of mine who was in the classes with me – we called them the “stupid math and English classes” because we had a 1 or 2 other students with us and one teacher. 
        </p>
        <p class="editable">I received extra time on tests and extra tutoring. I would still pretend I was no different than the other kids, even though they would ask “why did it take you so long to write the test?”, “where did you go?”, “why do you get extra time?”, “what makes you so special that you get extensions on assignments?”</p>

        <h2>Looking back I am so <span class="featured-text"> grateful</span> for this experience</h2>
        <p class="editable">
            My mom was such an advocate in getting extra support for me through school. I have an entire life time of experience navigating the system with ADHD. Over the years, I grew resentful towards my brain. I felt as if it was letting me down. I managed to get through junior high and high school with below average grades in most classes and a lot of misconduct along the way. 
        <p class="editable">
            I went on to complete my Diploma of Architectural Technologies in Calgary, Alberta. Prior to starting classes the College required me to get re-tested by a Psychologist to prove I still had ADHD. They wanted to confirm before they would provide extra support. 
            The results came back – <span class="featured-text"> I still had ADHD and I successfully completed the program. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="editable">
            My grades went through the roof and I was determined to complete this course within the allotted time alongside my peers. With a new found passion for design - I wanted to get into Interior Design at university which required me to retake my English exam because my marks from high school were too low. I STRUGGLED with writing – it often brought me to tears. I wrote the exam twice and got no better results. So, my dreams of being an interior designer were put on the back burner.

        <h2>Feeling a little deflated I <span class="featured-text">shifted my focus</span></h2>
        <p class="editable">
            I decided to chase and endless summer and travel to Australia. 

            I ended up travelling there for a year and I wanted to stay. So I had to sign up for university to get a visa to stay for longer. I ended up getting accepted to the beautiful Universtiy of the Sunshine Coast in Queensland for a Bachelor of Health Promotion. (They had Kangaroos on campus!)
            
            I was on medication for my ADHD at the time – and to get approved my medication – I had to go visit a family doctor who referred me to a psychologist who referred me to a Psychiatrist to ensure that I still had ADHD. 
            
            <span class="featured-text">Yep, it was confirmed – I still had ADHD. </span>
            
                    </p>
        <p class="editable">
            Early in my studies, writing came back to haunt me. I was brand new to the Sunshine Coast and I had no friends except a boyfriend that worked away. </p>
            <p class="editable">
            I went into my first week of classes – I had to take an Australia history class which I knew nothing about. They told us we had to write a paper that was due in 4 weeks. I went into a panic because I didn’t know how to write nor did I know anything about the topic.
        </p>
        <p class="editable"> I went home that evening and felt an impending doom. What was I thinking? Why did I sign up to this program? I promised myself when I registered I would see it through. I had moved all the way overseas away from everything I knew. </p>

        <p class="editable"></p>I felt alone and like my world was coming crashing down. I started to ugly cry in the shower of course. Because ugly crying in the shower is better. I was crying because didn’t know how to write. I had just signed up for an extremely expensive international studies. When I caught my breathe I decided to get out of the shower – I looked at myself in the mirror and laughed at myself. </p>
            
       <p class="editable"> <span class="featured-text">“Get it together AnnMarie, go and figure out how to write”. </span> </p>
            
       <p class="editable"> I went into the international office the next day and I said I needed extra time – I was still visibly in a fragile state. So they helped me extend my studies so I had a smaller course load each semester. </p>

            <h2>I ended up graduating <span class="featured-text"> <br> with honors</span> </h2>
            <p class="editable">
                I hated writing so much that I had my mind set on getting SO much support with tutoring that the tutors would write my papers for me. HA! Joke was on me – they actually helped me learn how to write. I took every single extra tutoring course there was to improve my writing. The first 2 years it took me forever to write my papers. </p>
            <p class="editable">
                After graduation, I interviewed at several companies just coming shy of getting the role with my degree. I was still in Australia and ended up getting a job with a company designing and selling custom kitchens. I loved it!

            <p class="editable">Fast forward, I came back home to Canada after I ran out of visas. I continued working in Cabinetry design until I got fired for being too persistent doing things my own way. Before I was fired, I started working with a business coach and came to her with nothing. I said “I don’t know what I want to do but I want to be successful and I want to help people”. </p>
                
            <span class="featured-text font-bold">We threw around a few ideas and ADHD Coaching was born. </span>
